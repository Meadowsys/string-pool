# string-pool

Global immutable string pool, like Java. Made for fun / for educational purposes. It might be production ready, it might not, who knows :p

Do file issues if stuff doesn't work as expected / for feature requests. Don't expect them to be fixed in a timely manner, but this is low-key kinda fun to work on and I am learning a lot about rust doing this, soooo..... yeah, we'll see how things go, make of that what you will heh
